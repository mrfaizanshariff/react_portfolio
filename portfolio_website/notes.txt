Create the container component Folders within container Folder
we can export all the components from container folder at once by putting them in an index.js file within container folder, and exporting them from there
import { About, Testimonial, Footer, Header, Work, Skills } from "./container";
we can import them by  using the above import statement
llly we can import components also from components folder using the index.js file and exporting them
